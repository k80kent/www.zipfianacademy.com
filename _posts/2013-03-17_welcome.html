title: Welcome to Zipfian
---
<p>We enthusiastically welcome anyone and everyone who has a childlike curiosity about not just <em>how</em> the world works, but <em>why</em> the world works to join the Zipfian community!</p>
<h4>Won’t you join us on our intellectual journey</h4>
<p>We are embarking on a mission to push the bounds of what is possible with data — exploring the core of what it really means to be a data scientist.</p>
<p><a href="http://zipfianacademy.com" target="_blank">Zipfian Academy</a> is an attempt to make the world a bit more transparent — by arming dedicated individuals with the skills necessary to make sense of the mountain of data before us. We dream of a world in which no claim gets accepted without evidence to support it, no information that could improve the state of our world is sequestered, and the tools and knowledge to ask the right questions are open and freely available.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit that we invite you to join the conversation. Tell us a story, give us your opinion — this is a place to be heard. We look forward to hearing from all of you!</p>
<p>— Jonathan &amp; Ryan</p>
